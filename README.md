## Overview

This project is from Scrimba's Frontend Path course. It is a simple React component showcasing a virtual business card.

**This is NOT a tutorial project.** I built this utilizing the skills I acquired from the course as well as my own knowledge. There is no official solution.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- React JS
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I built this component using React and Tailwind CSS, using Vite as the bootstrap. This was my first experience on the Scrimba course creating a React component, and using a modern bootstrapper such as Vite.

I used semantic markup in each of the component files in order to get familiar with building sites with accessibility in mind.

I solidified my existing knowledge of certain React concepts, such as importing images to use in img tags instead of using a file path, and using the @import-normalize directive to import a CSS Reset into my project instead of using another source.

Using Tailwind CSS helped me get accustomed to an industry framework that many companies use to enable faster development.

**See below for the Footer Component**:

```JSX
import Twitter from "../assets/twitter.png";
import Facebook from "../assets/facebook.png";
import Instagram from "../assets/instagram.png";
import Github from "../assets/github.png";

export default function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer className="bg-[#161619] flex justify-center gap-x-8 py-5">
      <img src={Twitter} alt="Twitter" />
      <img src={Facebook} alt="Facebook" />
      <img src={Instagram} alt="Instagram" />
      <img src={Github} alt="Github" />
    </footer>
  )
}
```
